SPEAKER_02," up to it, worried about it going well, worried about collateral damage, making sure that everyone gets out safely. So it's probably a huge sense of relief today.",0.0,8.16
SPEAKER_01, We'll say it's a little bit shameful that President Biden would do this when he's supposed to be recovering from COVID. It's also culture run amuck. Commander-in-Chief's orders. What about dog disorders?,8.16,23.56
SPEAKER_00," That's a good point. I thought so. It's a good point. A dumb point, but a good point. Thank you very much. Thank you. Let's talk about the Doha Accords that were part of the withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. How many tickets? Okay, you can take this one, because the Taliban agreed to quote not allow groups, including Al-Qaeda to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten security of the United States. Shocker. The Taliban lied to us. Okay. How do you incentivize compliance to that kind of agreement other than sending the flying steak knives, which we did?",23.56,75.4
SPEAKER_02," I think the key point here is President Biden was right to end the war in Afghanistan after decades. I think what this, you can climb to that. To me, I don't think we ever trusted the Taliban to live up to their, or shouldn't we, but what this operation shows in my mind is that you don't need 100,000 troops in countries all around the world to conduct counterterrorist operations. And I think that's a good lesson for the United States.",75.4,102.04
SPEAKER_00," Okay. All right. And another foreign policy news. Just to jump in here many times. And other foreign policy news, speaker Pelosi landed in Taiwan today for a trip that military leaders, not only Chinese military leaders, but American military leaders said was not a great idea for her to go.",102.04,125.48
SPEAKER_01," Look, I know it's a controversial trip. But given we are husband-grimes, I think it's exciting when she gets anywhere.",125.48,132.2
SPEAKER_00, Wow. I read the news. Wow. Some of the audience reads the news as well. I'm so sorry.,132.2,138.72
SPEAKER_01," How do you guys feel about that? He had a DUI. That's a joke about a DUI. Tommy, you want to take this one? Yeah. That's all done. We have seen it.",138.72,147.72
SPEAKER_00," Why do you think she went anyway? But yet both the Chinese were saying, don't go. And the Biden administration was saying, yeah, please don't go. Why do you think she went? Nancy Pelosi has been a fierce critic of the Chinese Communist Party's human rights record",147.72,158.72
SPEAKER_02," for decades. And I think sure thinking was, I'm not going to let the leaders of any country, but alone China tell me where and when I can travel. So, is there some risk associated with this trip? Yes. Have the Chinese responded in ways that are already inflammatory and problematic and could they do more? Yes. But, you know, I don't want to tell Nancy what to do. I don't have the stones to do that for you.",158.72,181.72
SPEAKER_00," We have to take quick break. But when we come back, I will talk to John Favreau, John Loveon, Tommy Vittor, about the hit-term election stick around.",181.72,195.72
