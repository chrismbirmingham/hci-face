SPEAKER_01," that President, President Biden would do this while he's supposed to be recovering from COVID. It's hustle culture run amok. Commander in Chief's orders. What about doctors orders?",11.04,23.36
SPEAKER_00," That's a good point. I thought so. It's a good point. It's a good point. A dumb point, but a good point. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Let's talk about the Doha Accords that were part of the withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. Tom, you take this one. Okay, you take this one. Sure. Because the Taliban agreed to quote, not allow groups, including Al Qaeda, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten security of the United States. Shocker, the Taliban lied to us. Okay. How do you incentivize compliance to that kind of agreement other than sending the flying steak knives, which we did? I think the key point",25.04,76.4
SPEAKER_02," here is President Biden was right to end the war in Afghanistan after decades. I think what this, you can clap for that. To me, I don't think we ever trusted the Taliban to live up to their commitments, or should we, but what this operation shows in my mind is that you don't need 100,000 troops in countries all around the world to conduct counter terrorist operations.

SPEAKER_00," That's all the time we have, Stephen. Why do you think she went anyway? If both the Chinese were saying, don't go, and the Biden administration was saying, yeah, please don't go, why do you think",147.44,156.48
SPEAKER_02," she went? Nancy Pelosi has been a fierce critic of the Chinese Communist Party's human rights record for decades, and I think her thinking was, I'm not going to let the leaders of any country, let alone China, tell me where and when I can travel. So is there some risk associated with this trip? Yes. Have the Chinese responded in ways that are already inflammatory and problematic, and could they do more?
