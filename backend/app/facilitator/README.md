# Facilitator

The Facilitator is an attempt to create a support group facilitator. 

The logic is contained in facilitator_logic.py, with a set of custom classifcations, methods for generating role model and director type facilitation responses, and presets for a facilitation study.

To talk with the facilitator run the following from the /app directory
```
python -m facilitator.facilitator_bot
```
